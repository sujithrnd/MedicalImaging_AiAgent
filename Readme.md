## 🚀 Overview
- Built an Agentic AI–based medical imaging system to analyse X-ray, MRI, CT scan, and ultrasound images for AI-assisted diagnosis support.
- Designed a multi-agent architecture with Medical Imaging Analysis Agent, Diagnostic Reasoning Agent, and Healthcare Coordinator Agent to autonomously process and interpret scans.
- Leveraged Gemini Flash LLM to generate contextual diagnostic insights and explanations from imaging outputs.
- Implemented Agentic AI design patterns (Tool Use, ReAct, Planning) to enable autonomous decision-making and reasoning across medical workflows.
- Integrated AI medical imaging pipelines to detect anomalies and highlight potential issues that may be overlooked in manual review.
- Enabled AI-assisted clinical Q&A, allowing doctors to ask questions about scans and receive explainable responses.
- Developed a smart AI healthcare assistant to support doctors with faster image interpretation and patient diagnosis insights.
- Architected the system to be modular, extensible, and cloud-ready, supporting hospital-scale deployment and future imaging modalities.
